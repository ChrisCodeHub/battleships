Each player needs :

- A "sea" for their fleet
- A "sea" to track their shots
- The ability to place their fleet of ships
- Track what they are hitting
- Feedback if they are being hit
- Take turns to shoot
- Indicate when their Battleship is sunk



- A "sea" for their fleet ?
Or do we just need a fleet with a record of what co-ordinates its occupying - seems a better idea?

- Track what they are hitting
Nice to use this as smarter targetting. If you get a hit, odds are in your favour around that spot

Will have high level logic that creates the players, it can tell player1 they go first
Being shot is a token - when you get shot, you need to respond with a hit/miss - then take your shot
Can work out next shot (tagetting) whilst being shot at - no need to just sit idle whilst opponent is shooting

Need to tell opponent they have won
Need to tell high level control when you lose
