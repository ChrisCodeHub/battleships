The intent of this project is just to play around and keep fresh with various languages.  More weight is given to write code to experiment, than write code to be the most optimal. Having said that, I really don't like "Citadels of Complexity" so keeping code simple is nice when I can

What is Battleships:

- A game of 2 players
- Each player has a grid ( in this case 20x20 ) - their "sea"
- Each player has a small fleet of ships that they place on that grid.
  - a Tug ( length 1)
  - a Minesweeper ( length 2)
  - 2 Frigate's ( length 3 each)
  - 1 Battleship ( length 5 each)
- Ships are placed on the Grid, they can run
  - Horizontal
  - Vertical
  - On the Diagonal
- Players take turn to "fire" at a grid location on their opponents "sea"
  - the opposing player will tell the other if that "shot" hit a ship, or "missed"
- First player to sink the other players battleship, wins
